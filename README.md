#Amazon CloneAmazon Clone
Goal was to clone amazon with payment feature enabled

First I made the front end using react. This clone have 4 pages Login page, Home page, Cart page and payment page. Payment feature is enabled using stripe element. All user authentication and all orders placed are stored in firebase and all payment info are saved in stripe.

User can make his/her account and then can login in it. Then using home page user can add products to the cart. User can edit selected products on the cart page also and can see the subtotal of products. From there user will be redirected to payment page where user can enter details of debit/credit card and can buy the products (payment is dummy, amount is not debited from user account)
